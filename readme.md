Code behind the blog post: http://abe.is/analyzing-citibike-usage/

1. Run aggregated on the server for the whisper files
2. Run get_temp locally to get updated temps

Future work:

1. A rebalancing predictor and scheduler?
2. A thing to predict if there will be bikes (probability of empty dock, assuming no rebalancing)
